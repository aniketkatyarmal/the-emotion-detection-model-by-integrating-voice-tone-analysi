#Emotion Detection Model with Voice Tone Analysis Integration
Overview
This project aims to develop an emotion detection model that integrates voice tone analysis. By analyzing voice recordings, the model can identify the emotional state of the speaker, providing valuable insights for various applications such as customer service, mental health monitoring, and human-computer interaction.

Features
Emotion detection using machine learning algorithms.
Integration of voice tone analysis techniques.
Support for real-time emotion detection from audio input.
User-friendly interface for easy interaction and deployment.
Technologies Used
Python: Programming language used for model development and implementation.
Scikit-learn: Library for machine learning algorithms and data preprocessing.
TensorFlow/Keras: Framework for building and training deep learning models.
Librosa: Library for audio analysis and feature extraction.
Flask: Web framework for creating RESTful APIs for model deployment.
